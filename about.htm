My name is William Jung and after 20 successful years working as an elementary teacher in the Milwaukee Public Schools, I realized that my goals for the future extended beyond the school environment. I am now actively seeking to contribute my comprehensive computer and technology expertise, excellent written and verbal communication skills, electronics skill set, and management capabilities to the business world.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1989 (Music), and I received my Certification in Elementary Education (1- 6) in June of 1996. My knowledge and abilities range far beyond my academic studies in Education, Music, Math, and Computer Science, and are the direct result of my belief in lifelong learning. My technical knowledge of computer software applications, Internet application development, programming languages, and network operating systems is extraordinary, and I am eager to apply that knowledge in a business setting.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My current position as a Captioning Assistant at CapTel, Inc. has furthered my business acumen and proven my facility with technology in a business work environment. My years as a teacher resulted in a mastery of organization and management skills. During the 8 years I spent as a classroom teacher my personal strengths were evident not only in my spoken and written communication competencies, but were verified through the success of my students on standardized tests. My communication and collaboration skills were also evident during my 12 years as a Technology Coordinator and Staff Trainer. I created numerous technology training documents and videos, and I received the highest overall MPS Status of Exemplary on the Administration's Teacher Evaluation Form for 7 years. I received successful evaluations on all of the rest of my evaluations.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have a deep understanding of the LAMP web platform and have utilized my knowledge of Linux (OS), Apache (Web Server), MySQL (Relational Database), PHP, C, and Javascript, to create web sites and application servers for schools during my tenure as a School Technology Coordinator. While I did complete some Computer Science course work at UW-Milwaukee, most of my knowledge and skill has been acquired on the job and from books and online resources. I first learned about computer programming when I worked for Hal Leonard Publishing. I initially created batch files to help in the engraving process, and then I moved on to writing QBasic and Visual Basic programs to further increase engraving efficiency at Hal Leonard Publishing.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My ability to build and repair computers and electronics is also significant, and my command of electronic schematics is the direct result of building circuits for music effects, Arduino, and the Rasberry Pi platform. I have an impressive command of all Office Applications including spreadsheets (MS and Google), Graphic Arts (Photoshop, Illustrator), Video Production (Final Cut Pro, Premier, After Effects), Music Creation and Editing software (Pro Tools, Cakewalk Sonar).
