        My name is William Jung and after 20 successful years working as a Technlogy Coordinator and Elementary Teacher in the Milwaukee Public Schools, I realized that my goals for the future extended beyond the school environment. I am now applying my computer and technology skills, electronics skill set, and management capabilities to the business world.

        I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1989 (Music), and I received my Certification in Elementary Education (1- 6) in June of 1996. My knowledge and abilities range far beyond my academic studies in Education, Music, Math, and Computer Science, and are the direct result of my belief in lifelong learning.

        My current position in Technology & Equipment Sales Support and Media Development at Exponential Power has given me the opportunity to learn sales, customer support, Netsuite, Hootsuite, and utilize my educational and technical expertise to develop videos and documents for clients. My knowledge of Visual Basic for Applications has also been employed to streamline MS Office procedures.
		<p>My years as a teacher resulted in a mastery of organization and management skills. During my 8 years as a classroom teacher my instructional skills were verified through the success of my students on standardized tests.
		<p>My communication and collaboration skills were evident during my 12 years as a Technology Coordinator and Staff Trainer. I received the highest overall MPS Status of Exemplary on the Administration’s Teacher Evaluation Form for 7 years, and commendations on all other evaluations.</p>

        I have a deep understanding of the LAMP web platform and have utilized my knowledge of Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, HTML5, CSS, and Javascript, to create web sites and application servers for businesses and schools.
		<p>My knowledge of networks and programming languages was initially fostered during my tenure at Hal Leonard Publishing, where I created scripts and Visual Basic programs to further increase music engraving efficiency. I have leveraged all of that acquired knowledge in the development of Mobile Apps employing Java and Android Studio.</p>

        My ability to build and repair computers and electronics is significant, and my command of electronic schematics is the direct result of building circuits for music effects, Arduino, and the Rasberry Pi platform.
		<p>I have a thorough command of all Office applications, Graphic Arts  (Photoshop), Page Layout (InDesign), Video Production (Adobe Premier Pro, After Effects), and Music Production (Audition). I am at my best when I'm combining an artistic sensibility with a current technology, and I look forward to continuing my contributions to the business world.</p>
